    <h2>Main Focus</h2>
    <p>Casa de Perritos is an organization that fosters puppies without homes. The mission of Casa de Perritos is to find forever homes for these wonderful furry companions. This organization was first established in August of 2020, it was founded by the Gonzalez family of five, mother, father, daughter and younger brothers all help support and maintain the small shelter. Over the years the capacity count of the shelter has increased more than itâ€™s decreased. As of now the count is 15, Casa de Perritos is located in a 1200 square feet piece of land and about half of it is taken up by the living facilities of the Gonzalez family; therefore there is not much land left for the puppies to run around in , consequently Casa de Perritos has decided to cap their shelter limit at 15 puppies. We also offer a couple hours of paid labor for residents looking to spend a couple hours a day walking the puppies. 
      In the future we hope to an accredited non-profit organization, and eventually expand our facilities and hire staff. But for now we just want to bring awareness to our organization.
